# OpenSSF Scorecard Gaps

<!-- Assisted by: cursor, claude -->

Actionable Scorecard checks, current scores, targets, and which PLAN phases address each gap.

**Baseline:** Scorecard **6.0** @ fork `main` `6b0a209` (2026-06-30, Phase 8 close). SAST **10/10** after Phase 6 CodeQL. Prior PLAN cited **5.2** — stale.

See [`.github/workflows/scorecard-analysis.yml`](../../.github/workflows/scorecard-analysis.yml) and [`docs/project/PLAN.md`](../project/PLAN.md) Phases 8–11.

## Documented waivers (Phase 8)

These checks are **not** targeted for improvement on the contributor fork; rationale recorded for Scorecard gap triage.

### Maintained (score 0)

- **Reason:** Fork created from upstream recently; Scorecard “Maintained” expects sustained commit activity over ~90 days.
- **Action:** No code change. Re-evaluate after Phases 9–11 if score remains 0 on a mature fork tip.
- **Phase:** 8 baseline doc only.

### Contributors (score 3)

- **Reason:** Solo contributor fork; limited distinct contributor count is expected (see [`PLAN.md`](../project/PLAN.md) Decisions).
- **Action:** No code change. Upstream merge or additional collaborators may raise this organically.
- **Phase:** 8 baseline doc only.

## Phase mapping

| Phase  | Goal                        | Merge gate                                  |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **8**  | OpenSSF score baseline      | `make check` + doc only; record 6.0 in PLAN |
| **9**  | Dependency hygiene          | `make check` + `make smoke`; green CI       |
| **10** | Branch protection hardening | `make check`; document ruleset changes      |
| **11** | Pin remaining dependencies  | `make check`; Pinned-Dependencies → 10/10   |

## Phase 9 triage (batch 2 complete)

**Branch:** `feat/phase-9-dependency-hygiene-batch2` (open PR).

**Baseline:** Batch 1 merged @ `30c55ef` (PR #35, 2026-06-30).

| #16 | `react-dom` 19.2.7        | **Merged** — paired with #14                             |
| #17 | `react-leaflet` 5.0.0     | **Merged** — build pass; map UX not cluster-validated    |
| #18 | `three` 0.185.0           | **Merged** — globe build pass; cluster UX not validated  |
| #19 | `form-data` 4.0.6         | **Merged** — transitive patch via `npm update form-data` |
| #22 | `pillow` 12.2.0 (partial) | **Merged** — backend-detection remainder                 |

### Still deferred

None from the Phase 9 batch 2 scope. Re-run Dependabot alert count on `main` after batch 2 merge.

### Blockers resolved in batch 2

- **numpy 2:** requirements bump only; health smoke passes (no ONNX inference in smoke profile).
- **React 19:** CRA 5 build succeeds after removing unused imports in `App.js`.
- **react-leaflet 5:** peer deps satisfied with React 19; production build passes.

**Cluster validation gap:** React 19 / Three 0.185 / react-leaflet 5 map and globe UX remain unvalidated on cluster until Phase 13 baseline sign-off.

### Deferred (risky major / needs dedicated testing) — historical

| #19 | npm group (frontend)      | Transitive; review after React/Three deferrals       |
| #22 | `pillow` 12.2.0 (partial) | Remainder of grouped PR; kept at 10.3.0 in detection |
